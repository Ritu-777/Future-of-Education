            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
                discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators,
                however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings
                and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and
                through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.
                As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
                imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]
                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

            <p class="sectionSubTag"> Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education,
                is
                the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or
                secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate
                education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly provide
                tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who
                complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees. The ISCED
                distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7 is
                equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8 is an advanced research
                qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of
                publishable quality based on original research. The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle
                courses of requiring degree level study.</p>
